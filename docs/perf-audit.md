# Performance audit: where the time goes in Kokiri (2026-11-08)

Machine: Ryzen 7 7800X3D, RTX 5070 12 GB, window 1280x720, the game image 2560x1440. Scene: Kokiri Forest, Link standing, about
3,050 draws a frame. Run: `scripts/bench-replay.sh` (the steady scene), `scripts/walk-test.sh` (a scripted walk), `HOS_SAMPLE` with
`scripts/prof.py` and `scripts/prof_callers.py` (a thread sampled every millisecond, named from the linker maps).

## What bounds the frame rate

| Thread | Busy | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Presentation Thread (the game's render thread, which replays the NVN stream inline) | 80-86% | the frame's critical path: ~15-16 ms a frame |
| sead::MainThread (the game's logic) | 23% | 77% of its samples wait for the render thread; its busiest guest function is under 1% |
| GPU | ~8.7 ms a frame | not the limit (RTX 5070); at 64 fps the overlay shows 5.9 ms busy |

At 52-55 fps the frame is the replay's 15-16 ms plus a little guest work. A frame rate above 60 needs the replay under ~8 ms.

## The replay thread (steady scene, % of its samples)

| Cost | Share | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `draw()` and what it calls | 48% | 3,050 draws, ~3.2 us each |
| of which `build_descriptors` (self + callees) | 19% | resolves ~30 descriptors a draw: uniform ranges, storage buffers through the driver banks, textures through the handle table |
| NVIDIA driver (`nvoglv64.dll`, leaf) | 20-25% | `bind_descriptors` (push descriptors) 4%, `vkCmdDraw` and the pipeline binds 4%, barriers and copies of the mirror syncs 3% |
| compute dispatches (culling passes, 147 a frame) | 7% | |
| mirror syncs and write-backs | 5-6% | 22 MB in 5,600 copies and 67 MB written back a frame |
| waiting for the game's thread (`queue_get`) | 13-14% | the replay is not always fed |
| `program_for` (per draw program lookup) | 8% | mesh draws take the shader lock, build the key and check texture types at every draw. A quick answer for them was tried and backed out: no measurable gain, and a mesh variant depends on texture types the bindings' generations do not follow |
| counter reports (`memory_cpu_owned`) | was 3.5% | fixed: a bitmap per guest page |

Fixed: the TLS init wrapper calls (~3%), the CPU-owned word tracking (~3.5%). Together about 5% of a frame, within the run to run noise
of ~5%.

## Guest functions that a host function could replace

None worth replacing. The game's logic thread is 77% idle, and its self time is spread thin: the busiest guest function takes under 1% of
its samples, `collect_in` (a host function) 1.1%. The libc style work (memcpy, memset, sqrt) already goes through the host (`ucrtbase` 5%).
Replacing guest code would gain nothing on the critical path, which is the render thread.

## What could still move the frame rate (largest first, with the cost)

1. Fewer draws to replay. The game draws every candidate (the fork has no real occlusion counts: each draw adds 16 samples). Real
   counts (GPU occlusion queries, results a frame late) removed ~29% of the draws in the oot-pc port, at the price of stale-count flashes.
   `HOOKSHOT_OCCLUSION_OFF=1` stops the game making its occlusion queries (50 fps against 45 in one run, inside the noise).
2. Fewer driver calls per draw: push descriptors to pre-built descriptor sets (bindless, as the oot-pc port did), or descriptor buffers.
   The driver is 20-25% of the thread and `build_descriptors` 19%.
3. Recording on more than one thread. `RX_VK_PARALLEL=4` gave 55 -> 65 fps but one-frame flashes come back (5 in 25 s with the flash
   detector); `RX_VK_ASYNC=1` was slower (32 fps).
4. A frame generation setting (the menu's 2x, 3x) for the display rate.
